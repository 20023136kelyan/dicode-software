Below is a **single unified Markdown spec** that covers **both**:

### ✅ **Question Generation**

(Used when the system automatically creates questions from a video)

### ✅ **Question Verification**

(Used when the user manually enters questions and the LLM must check compliance)

This is the **master specification file** your LLM can load to govern both workflows.
It is structured, strict, complete, and aligned with your PDF standards.
You can place it inside your repo under something like:

# 🎯 **CROSSAND QUESTIONNAIRE SPECIFICATION**

**For Workplace Video Scenarios — Generation + Verification Rules**
**Version:** 1.0
**Frameworks:** DI Code Behavioral Framework + High-Fidelity Behavioral Analytics 
**Purpose:**

* Provide strict rules for *question generation*
* Provide strict rules for *manual question validation*
* Ensure psychometric reliability, behavioral computability, and Gen Z cognitive load compatibility

---

# ---------------------------------------------

# **1. OVERVIEW**

# ---------------------------------------------

This specification standardizes how the system produces and validates questions following a video scenario.

Every question set must adhere to a **2+1 architecture**:

1. **Q1 — Behavioral Perception** *(quantitative)*
2. **Q2 — Behavioral Intent / Application** *(quantitative)*
3. **Q3 — Qualitative Insight** *(optional short text)*

The purpose is to:

* assess how users interpret workplace behaviors
* measure how they would respond
* gather explainable insight for LLM-coded analytics
* ensure questions are computable for longitudinal behavior modeling

---

# ---------------------------------------------

# **2. QUESTION GENERATION RULES (SYSTEM-CREATED)**

# ---------------------------------------------

This section defines how the system must *generate* questions automatically from scenario metadata.

## **2.1 Inputs Required for Generation**

The generator consumes:

### **A. Scenario Metadata**

* competence/behavior tag (DI Code category)
* conflict / event summary
* emotional states
* correct behavior to teach
* characters involved
* workplace setting

### **B. Cinematic Metadata**

Used to adjust phrasing difficulty:

* clarity level of video
* environment type
* lighting accuracy
* camera angles
* motion complexity

### **C. Output Requirements**

The generated questions must be:

* short
* behavior-specific
* computable
* one construct per question
* designed with Gen Z cognitive load in mind

---

## **2.2 Generation Templates**

### **Q1: Behavioral Perception (Quantitative)**

**Definition:** Measures understanding or interpretation of the behavior shown.

**Template Types:**

* “How clearly did you understand {behavior/conflict}?”
* “How accurately did you perceive {Person A}’s emotional state?”
* “How well did the video show {specific behavior indicator}?”

**Scale:** 1–7 + Don't Know

---

### **Q2: Behavioral Intent / Application (Quantitative)**

**Definition:** Measures likelihood of applying the correct behavior.

**Template Types:**

* “How likely are you to respond with {correct behavior} in a similar situation?”
* “How confident would you feel handling a situation like this?”
* “How likely are you to avoid the problematic behavior shown?”

**Scale:** 1–7 + Don't Know

---

### **Q3: Qualitative Insight (Optional Short Text)**

**Definition:** Captures user reasoning.
**Usage:** LLM will code themes for behavioral barriers.

**Template Types:**

* “What influenced how you interpreted this situation?”
* “What would make responding correctly easier or harder?”
* “What stood out to you most in this scenario?”

---

## **2.3 Generation Rules**

The system **must:**

1. Produce questions ≤ **18 words**
2. Use simple, familiar language
3. Avoid ambiguous qualifiers (never use “often”, “sometimes”, “usually”)
4. Never combine two constructs in one question
5. Ensure numeric computability for Q1 & Q2
6. Make questions strictly about the scenario presented
7. Ensure Q3 does not contain evaluative or sensitive content
8. Follow the mandated structure: Q1 → Q2 → (Q3 optional)

If generation fails any rule, regenerate automatically.

---

# ---------------------------------------------

# **3. QUESTION VERIFICATION RULES (USER-CREATED)**

# ---------------------------------------------

When a user manually enters questions, the LLL must verify compliance with the same standards.

## **3.1 Acceptance Criteria**

A manual question set is **Valid** only if:

* Includes Q1 and Q2
* Follows the order Q1 → Q2 → (Q3 optional)
* Q1 and Q2 are quantitative and map to a 7-point scale
* Each question measures **one construct only**
* Language is plain, clear, and Gen Z friendly
* No psychological manipulation or evaluation
* No ambiguous time words
* Questions relate directly to the video
* Q3 is optional but must be qualitative if present

---

## **3.2 Automatic Rejection Conditions**

Reject a question set if:

* More or fewer than 2–3 questions
* Q1 or Q2 is non-quantitative
* A question contains multiple constructs
* The wording is ambiguous or too complex
* Questions cannot produce numeric data
* Content is irrelevant to the scenario
* Questions imply personal identity, diagnosis, or sensitive traits
* Q3 is missing but Q1 or Q2 is malformed
* Q3 is quantitative instead of qualitative
* Any question exceeds 18 words
* Any includes qualifiers (“often”, “sometimes”, “typically”, “regularly”)

---

## **3.3 What the LLM Must Output During Verification**

When verifying, the LLM must output:

```
VALIDITY: Valid / Invalid
REASONS: (list all violations)
SUGGESTED FIX: (provide corrected question set)
```

---

# ---------------------------------------------

# **4. EXAMPLES OF VALID QUESTION SETS**

# ---------------------------------------------

## **Scenario: Interrupting Colleague in a Meeting**

**Q1:** “How clearly did you understand why the interruption occurred?”
**Q2:** “How likely are you to support the interrupted colleague in a real meeting?”
**Q3:** “What made interpreting this situation easier or harder?”

## **Scenario: Poorly Delivered Feedback**

**Q1:** “How well did you understand the feedback given?”
**Q2:** “How likely are you to deliver feedback constructively?”
**Q3:** “What could make giving such feedback easier?”

---

# ---------------------------------------------

# **5. FULL CHECKLIST (LLM MUST FOLLOW THIS)**

# ---------------------------------------------

### **5.1 For Every Q1 and Q2**

* ☐ One construct only
* ☐ Quantitative
* ☐ 7-point scale compatibility
* ☐ Clear & plain language
* ☐ ≤ 18 words
* ☐ No ambiguous qualifiers
* ☐ Directly tied to video behavior
* ☐ Not about personality traits
* ☐ Not evaluative or moralizing

### **5.2 For Q3**

* ☐ Optional
* ☐ Qualitative
* ☐ Reflection-based
* ☐ No sensitive personal information
* ☐ No psychological diagnosis
* ☐ Not a quantitative question

---

# ---------------------------------------------

# **6. DEVELOPER GUIDANCE**

# ---------------------------------------------

### **6.1 Question Generator Implementation**

* Uses scenario metadata → chooses templates
* Inserts variables {Person A}, {behavior}, {setting}
* Applies clarity/difficulty calibration based on cinematic metadata
* Enforces all rules before output

### **6.2 Validation Module Implementation**

* Loads this MD
* Evaluates each user question set line-by-line
* Rejects with specific reasons
* Suggests corrected questions
* Logs violations for analytics
* Ensures consistency across all user-created content

---

# ---------------------------------------------

# **7. ETHICAL REQUIREMENTS**

# ---------------------------------------------

A question is invalid if it:

* pressures users
* shames or evaluates performance
* infers race, ethnicity, sexuality, religion
* asks about medical or mental health
* manipulates emotional response
* violates privacy-by-design principles 

The questionnaire’s purpose is to teach behavior — not judge identity.

---

# ---------------------------------------------

# **8. CONCLUSION**

# ---------------------------------------------

This specification ensures:

* Consistent behavioral data
* Psychometric validity
* Scalable longitudinal tracking
* Ethical, safe behavioral learning
* Smooth UX for Gen Z users
* Interchangeability between generated and manually entered questions

Your LLM can now **both generate new questions** AND **verify user-submitted questions** with complete reliability.
